# Chips Sales Analysis Report

## I. Market Overview
Based on our in-depth analysis of chips sales data, Mainstream market customers are the primary sales contributors, with Young Singles/Couples and Midage Singles/Couples segments showing particularly strong performance.

## II. Customer Segment Analysis

### 1. Sales Performance
The mainstream young singles/couples and retirees segments have the highest number of customers, directly driving higher sales volumes. We've observed that older families and young families generally purchase more chips per customer. Interestingly, the average spending across different categories (mainstream, budget, and premium) shows minimal variation.

### 2. Purchasing Behavior Characteristics
New families, young singles/couples, and retirees show a preference for larger package sizes and are willing to accept higher unit prices. Mainstream market customers generally demonstrate a higher willingness to pay premium prices for chips. Notably, mainstream midage and young singles/couples are more inclined to pay higher prices per packet compared to their budget and premium counterparts.

Premium market customers primarily purchase chips for entertainment purposes rather than personal consumption, and they tend to prefer healthier snack options. This is reflected in the lower number of premium midage and young singles/couples purchasing chips compared to their mainstream counterparts.

### 3. Brand Preferences
Kettle, Smiths, Doritos, and Pringles consistently emerge as the four most popular brands across all customer segments.
